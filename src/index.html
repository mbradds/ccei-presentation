                      Take a look at the links on the next slide. Highcharts can
                      be combined with other web frameworks/technologies to
                      create <strong>dashboard</strong> style vizualizations.

                        Highcharts, like most JavaScript frameworks is mobile
                        optimized by default. Try looking at this page on mobile

                        Highcharts plays nicely with other web technologies.

                        Highmaps is really good for creating simple, easy to use
                        maps. For more complicated mapping functionality,
                        somthing like Leaflet is a good option. More on this
                        later.

                        Highcharts is more ready than we are. It can handle data
                        of any size, dashboards of any complexity/functionality
                        requirements, live data, mobile design, etc.

                  No... But we need to think about what we are trying to
                  accomplish. Organizations such as ours have two completely
                  separate functions, and our choice of technology needs to
                  reflect this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of it this way. If you want to build a house, how many
                  tools would you bring to the worksite? What would happen if
                  you showed up with only a hammer in your toolbox? This is a
                  classic technology pitfall of most large organizations!

                  Are we interested in creating high quality
                  <strong>web based</strong>
                  dashboards and data products for
                  <strong>external audiences</strong>? If so, then take a look
                  at some of the reasons to switch! If not, then we can probably
                  end the presentation here...

                      Try clicking through some of the filter options in this
                      Tableau dashboard. Notice the time delay? Its not the end
                      of the world, but users really dont like this, and there
                      is nothing that can be done about it. Tableau and PowerBI
                      were not designed to play well on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tableau and PowerBI are rendered through something called
                      an iframe, which is kind of like looking through a large
                      tunnel into another computer. User interactions need to
                      pass through this tunnel and back again in order for the
                      user too see what they want. This is kind of a hack/band
                      aid solution for the web, but its the only way for Tableau
                      and PowerBI to work.

                    <p>
                      As we have seen, Highcharts (and other web/JavaScript)
                      based web frameworks dont have this latency issue, because
                      all files originate on the orginizations web server, and
                      the vizualization runs inside the users web browser,
                      eliminating the need for an iframe.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Note:</strong> This is only an issue on the web!
                      When creating Tableau/PowerBI dashboards on your computer,
                      you wont notice this issue, because the vizualization is
                      running on your local computer, instead of a server.

                      When set up properly, Highcharts vizualizations dont

                      Tableau and PowerBI are intended to be used as internal
                      business intelligence tools for management decision making
                      and analysis. What happens when we want to build a
                      visualiztion with functionality that isnt supported? What
                      happends when our external users/audience request products
                      that Tableau/PowerBI cant handle?

                    <p>
                      There are several examples of functionality on the
                      previous slide that cant be re-created with Tableau or
                      PowerBI. When moving to the Highcharts/JavaScript
                      ecosytem, there are no limits, because there is always
                      going to be a right tool for the job.

                      Highcharts is open source. This means that its (almost)
                      impossible for unsavory code to make its way in. Also, all
                      the code we write on top of Highcharts is open source, so
                      our clients can confirm that nothing shady is going on.

                      critical? Users dont like giving their exact location to

                      Moving to Highcharts unlocks the benefits that come with
                      the JavaScript ecosystem/community. Highcharts plays
                      nicely with the official Government of Canada styles (web
                      experience toolkit), helping to create a common look and
                      feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Highcharts plays nicely with other open source (and fully
                      free) software, such as leaflet for advanced mapping. This
                      ensures that you can use the absolute best tool for the
                      job!

                    <p>
                      What happens when something better than Highcharts comes
                      along? Switching from one web based charting framework to
                      another is much easier than the initial shift from PowerBI
                      to Highcharts.

                    <p>
                      The JavaScript ecosystem allows for much easier sharing of
                      work, and re-using old work compared to Tableau or
                      PowerBI. NPM (node package manager), allows me to download
                      and use JavaScript packages (such as Highcharts), but I
                      can also create my own NPM packages that others can use.

                      significant. The difference in price must be weighed
                      against the const of adopting a new technology,

                  This is a completely different way of doing things. It
                  requires different skills compared to Tableau/PowerBI.
                  Introducing a new technology also introduces alot of problems.
                  We are going through alot of these problems right now.

                  This is not a discussion about replacing, removing, or phasing

                  <strong>Tableau/PowerBI are irreplaceable</strong>, but they
                  are not always the best tool for the job.

                <p>
                  This is not an obvious decision, and it shouldn't be rushed
                  into. However the case for this kind of technology shift will
                  only get stronger in the future. I've categorized the
                  <i>reasons not to switch</i> into three categories;
                  <strong>Challenges, Risks, and Communication.</strong> Every
                  organization is different, but these are some of the biggest
                  issues i've faced.

                        <strong>Skills</strong> - This is harder to learn than
                        Tableau/PowerBI. Hiring experienced data viz developers
                        is expensive, and they are hard to come by.

                        <strong>Beating Tableau</strong> - There is a reason
                        Tableau/PowerBI are so successful. Their product is
                        really good. Its hard to create polished products that
                        are not just better than a tableau dashboard, but also
                        good enough to turn heads in the organization. Tableau
                        is so engrained in everything that we do, so things that
                        are not done in tableau are challenged (rightfully so).
                        The products I develop cant just be a little bit better
                        than Tableau/PowerBI, they need to be so far ahead that
                        a shift is worthwhile.

                        this new technology requires much closer collaboration
                        with our web team. Even when I do "all the work", this
                        group still needs to do alot to get things over the
                        finish line. The only problem I've had on this front is
                        we dont have a big enough web team!

                        to have a heavy hand in the data/design world as well.

                        Products like Highcharts didnt exist the way they do
                        even five years ago. The JavaScript/open source/web

            <h2>Why Highcharts specifically?</h2>

                  There is no reason. However Highcharts has some advantages
                  over other open source technologies that moved the needle for
                  us.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are lots of other substitutes for Highcharts. Take a
                  look at a few of them below. In my opinion, its more important
                  to just pick one and run with it for awhile, instead of
                  debating which one is the best.

                        good support for all major web browsers, really good API
                        documentation, and an active online community. These are

                      Can you tell why Highcharts has a paid license, and others
                      (Chart.js, D3.js, etc) are free? When you are learning how
                      to swim, maybe dont jump right into the deep end...
