                        Highcharts, like most JavaScript frameworks is mobile
                        optimized by default. Try looking at this page on mobile
                        (using Chrome dev tools), and compare it to a

                        Highcharts plays nicely with other web technologies.

                        Highmaps is really good for creating simple, easy to use
                        maps. For more complicated mapping functionality,
                        somthing like Leaflet is a good option. More on this
                        later.

                        Highcharts is more ready than we are. It can handle data
                        of any size, dashboards of any complexity/functionality
                        requirements, live data, mobile design, etc.

                  No... But we need to think about what we are trying to
                  accomplish. Organizations such as ours have two completely
                  separate functions, and our choice of technology needs to
                  reflect this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think of it this way. If you want to build a house, how many
                  tools would you bring to the worksite? What would happen if
                  you showed up with only a hammer in your toolbox? This is a
                  classic technology pitfall of most large organizations!

                  Are we interested in creating high quality
                  <strong>web based</strong>
                  dashboards and data products for
                  <strong>external audiences</strong>? If so, then take a look
                  at some of the reasons to switch! If not, then we can probably
                  end the presentation here...

                      Try clicking through some of the filter options in this
                      Tableau dashboard. Notice the time delay? Its not the end
                      of the world, but users really dont like this, and there
                      is nothing that can be done about it. Tableau and PowerBI
                      were not designed to play well on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Tableau and PowerBI are rendered through something called
                      an iframe, which is kind of like looking through a large
                      tunnel into another computer. User interactions need to
                      pass through this tunnel and back again in order for the
                      user too see what they want. This is kind of a hack/band
                      aid solution for the web, but its the only way for Tableau
                      and PowerBI to work.

                    <p>
                      As we have seen, Highcharts (and other web/JavaScript)
                      based web frameworks dont have this latency issue, because
                      all files originate on the orginizations web server, and
                      the vizualization runs inside the users web browser,
                      eliminating the need for an iframe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Note:</strong> This is only an issue on the web!
                      When creating Tableau/PowerBI dashboards on your computer,
                      you wont notice this issue, because the vizualization is
                      running on your local computer, instead of a server.

                      When set up properly, Highcharts vizualizations dont
                      depend on external resources/servers, and can only fail
                      when the organizations web server is down.

                      Tableau and PowerBI are intended to be used as internal
                      business intelligence tools for management decision making
                      and analysis. What happens when we want to build a
                      visualiztion with functionality that isnt supported? What
                      happends when our external users/audience request products
                      that Tableau/PowerBI cant handle?

                    <p>
                      There are several examples of functionality on the
                      previous slide that cant be re-created with Tableau or
                      PowerBI. When moving to the Highcharts/JavaScript
                      ecosytem, there are no limits, because there is always
                      going to be a right tool for the job.

                      What is Tableau & PowerBI doing with our data, and more
                      importantly, what are they doing with our users data? The
                      fact that all user interactions pass through
                      Tableau/PowerBI servers means that they can do whatever

                      Highcharts is open source. This means that its (almost)
                      impossible for unsavory code to make its way in. Also, all
                      the code we write on top of Highcharts is open source, so
                      our clients can confirm that nothing shady is going on.

                      Our audience (the general public) is starting to care more
                      about this. What have we seen so far where this is
                      critical? Users dont like giving their exact location to
                      websites, and probably not to government websites. We can
                      prove that we are not saving this information!

                      Moving to Highcharts unlocks the benefits that come with
                      the JavaScript ecosystem/community. Highcharts plays
                      nicely with the official Government of Canada styles (web
                      experience toolkit), helping to create a common look and
                      feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Highcharts plays nicely with other open source (and fully
                      free) software, such as leaflet for advanced mapping. This
                      ensures that you can use the absolute best tool for the
                      job!

                      What happens when something better than Highcharts comes
                      along? Switching from one web based charting framework to
                      another is much easier than the initial shift from PowerBI
                      to Highcharts.

                    <p>
                      The JavaScript ecosystem allows for much easier sharing of
                      work, and re-using old work compared to Tableau or
                      PowerBI. NPM (node package manager), allows me to download
                      and use JavaScript packages (such as Highcharts), but I
                      can also create my own NPM packages that others can use.

                      I dont know the exact price tag for Tableau or PowerBI,
                      but the difference compared to Highcharts may be
                      significant. The difference in price must be weighed
                      against the const of adopting a new technology,
                      re-training, etc.
